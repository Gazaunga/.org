* Basic Operations
** TODO Insert a character before or after the cursor.
** TODO Delete a character before or after the cursor and return the
  deleted character.
** TODO Move the cursor left or right (crossing line boundaries if
  necessary) and return the character or nil at the beginning
  or end of the buffer.
** TODO Move the cursor up or down a line and return nil/false only if a
  line boundary could not be crossed.  The cursor may be placed in
  the most natural column for the data structure.
  
* Intermediate Features
** TODO Get current line and column numbers
** TODO Copy some amount of text before or after the cursor and return  
  this buffer.
** TODO Display some context around the cursor.
** TODO Cut some amount of text before or after the cursor and return
  this buffer.
** TODO Paste a copy/cut buffer before or after the cursor.
** TODO Insert a file.
** TODO Write to a file.
** TODO Goto a specific line or column.
** TODO Goto the begin/end of the line/buffer.
** TODO Copy or cut to a specific line/column.
** TODO Filter some text through a ruby block.
** TODO Search (and possibly replace) using a regular expression.
** TODO Undo/redo.

* Bonus Tricks
** TODO Only store changes to a file.
** TODO Handle multiple efficient cursors in a text buffer.
